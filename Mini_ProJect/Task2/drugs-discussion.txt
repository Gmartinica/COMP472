With the data that we currently have, we have multiple specific models that have the same performance. 
The Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes, the Decision Tree, the Top Decision Tree, and the Perceptron did not respectively vary in their data. 
Since their standard deviation for the accuracy, macro-average and weighted-average are 0, this indicates that their mean is the same during every iteration, thus reaching the same result. 
This clearly changes with the Multi-Layered Perceptron and the Top Multi-Layered Perceptron. These two models utilize hidden layers. 
The whole process will thus change with each iteration as the weights that is applied to the inputs varies. 
Therefore, the average accuracy, average macro-average F1, and average weighted-average F1 will be different.
