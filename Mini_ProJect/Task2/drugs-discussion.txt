With the data that we currently have, we have multiple specific models that have relatively the same performance with varying degrees.
The Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes has the highest average across all 3 sets. The Decision Tree and the Top Decision Tree have identical values across its average. 
The Perceptron, Multi-Layered Perceptron and Top Multi-Layered Perceptron had all different values, they did not have similarities.
The standard deviation for the accuracy, macro-average and weighted-average are 0 for NB, Base-DT, Top-DT, and PER. 
This indicates that their mean is the same during every iteration, thus reaching the same result. 
This clearly changes with the Multi-Layered Perceptron and the Top Multi-Layered Perceptron. These two models utilize hidden layers. 
The whole process will thus change with each iteration as the weights that is applied to the inputs varies. 
Therefore, the average accuracy, average macro-average F1, and average weighted-average F1 will be different.
The standard deviation for both of these models will thus vary.
